    The smart token controller is an upgradable part of the smart token that allows
    more functionality as well as fixes for bugs/exploits.
    Once it accepts ownership of the token, it becomes the token's sole controller
    that can execute any of its functions.

    To upgrade the controller, ownership must be transferred to a new controller, along with
    any relevant data.

    The smart token must be set on construction and cannot be changed afterwards.
    Wrappers are provided (as opposed to a single 'execute' function) for each of the token's functions, for easier access.

    Note that the controller can transfer token ownership to a new controller that
    doesn't allow executing any function on the token, for a trustless solution.
    Doing that will also remove the owner's ability to upgrade the controller.
